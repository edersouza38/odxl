        <p>
            Welcome to ODXL!
        </p>
        <p>
            ODXL is an open data access layer written as a SAP HANA XS service.
            It lets you request data via an OData request, and return the requested data in various output formats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of the box, ODXL lets you export data in comma-separated values (.csv) format, or as MS Excel workbook (.xlsx).
            However, ODXL is designed to be extensible, and SAP HANA XS developers can add their own modules to handle other data formats.
        </p>
